    <!-- OUR STORY SECTION -->
<section class="about">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        What began as a simple spark between two people quickly grew into something neither of us could ignore.
        From the very first conversation, Joseph felt an ease and warmth with Shelby that felt like coming home,
        and Shelby found in Joseph a steady, genuine presence she had always hoped to find.
        <br><br>
        Our connection deepened through shared laughs, holiday decorations, our love of our pets,
        late-night discussions about the destruction of society through geopolitics, and our dark addiction to
        antique shopping (we need help). Bit by bit, friendship turned into partnership, and partnership turned
        into the kind of love that makes life feel fuller, brighter, and more vibrant and enduring with every step we take.
        <br><br>
        Together, we’ve built a relationship filled with adventure, growth, and an unwavering support for each other’s dreams.
        And now, as we prepare to say “I do” in the timeless elegance of the Venus Gardens, we’re celebrating not just a wedding day,
        but the journey that brought us here.
        <br><br>
        Join us for an elegant Roman Garden ceremony at the iconic Caesars Palace in Las Vegas—where we can lose our life savings,
        witness things we’ll never be able to explain, and fully embrace the true Vegas experience together.
        We’d be honored to have you be a part of this celebration!
