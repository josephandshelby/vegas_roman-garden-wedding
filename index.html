            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                What began as a simple spark between two people quickly grew into something neither of us could ignore. 
                From the very first conversation, Joseph felt an ease and warmth with Shelby that felt like coming home, 
                and Shelby found in Joseph a steady, genuine presence she had always hoped to find.
                <br><br>
                Our connection deepened through shared laughs, holiday decorations, the love of our pets, late-night chats, 
                and our dark addiction to antique shopping (we need help). Bit by bit, friendship turned into partnership, 
                and partnership turned into the kind of love that makes life feel fuller, brighter, and more vibrant with every step we take.
                <br><br>
                Together, we’ve built a relationship filled with adventure, growth, and unwavering support for one another. 
                And now, as we prepare to say “I do” in the timeless elegance of the Venus Gardens, we’re celebrating not just a wedding day, 
                but the journey that brought us here. Join us for an elegant Roman Garden ceremony at the iconic Caesars Palace in Las Vegas—where 
                we can lose our life savings, witness things we’ll never be able to explain, and fully embrace the true Vegas experience together. 
                We’d be honored to have you be a part of this celebration!
